        <strong>AI Feedback</strong><br><br>
        Based on the images you provided, here is an evaluation of your squat form using the visible keypoints:<br><br>
        1. <b>Starting Position (Images 1-3):</b><br>
           - You are standing upright with your feet about shoulder-width apart, which is a good stance.<br>
           - Your posture appears neutral, but it is difficult to observe the spine alignment precisely from this frontal view.<br><br>
        2. <b>Descent into Squat (Images 4-6):</b><br>
           - The hips are moving backward and knees are bending, which aligns with a proper squat.<br>
           - Your knees remain in line with your feet and do not seem to collapse inward, which is good for knee health.<br>
           - It looks like your knees might be slightly moving forward beyond your toes, which is generally acceptable within reason but should be controlled.<br>
           - Ensure you keep your chest up and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement to avoid leaning too far forward or rounding the back.<br><br>
        3. <b>Bottom of Squat (Images 7-9):</b><br>
           - Your thighs look parallel to the floor or slightly below, which indicates good squat depth.<br>
           - Your heels appear flat on the floor, which is important for stability.<br>
           - Make sure your weight stays evenly distributed on the mid-foot to heel, avoiding shifting too far to the toes.<br><br>
        <b>General Recommendations:</b><br>
        - To further refine the assessment, a side view video or photo would be very helpful for evaluating depth, back angle, and ankle mobility.<br>
        - Keep your core braced to protect your lower back.<br>
        - If you experience any discomfort in knees or back, consider working on mobility or consulting a professional trainer or physical therapist for personalized guidance.<br><br>
        Overall, your squat form looks quite solid from the frontal perspective you've provided. Keep focusing on maintaining good posture, knee alignment, and controlled movements throughout the squat.
